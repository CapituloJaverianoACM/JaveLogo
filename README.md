Forked from: https://code.google.com/p/nxt-remote-control/

Adds an additional window which lets the user write a list of commands to program the NXT robot. The main goal: Teach kids how to program during the [2013 hour of code hosted in the Javeriana, Bogota University](http://acm.javeriana.edu.co/2014/02/an-hour-of-code-2013-review/?lang=en).

It was also used in the second version of Javeriana ACM student chapter hour of code, where over 50 kids, learnt how to give instructions to robots using this code.<br><br>
